**LinearRegression.py** - Wrote my own LinearRegression from scratch with basic python and numpy
it start with random m and b values.
it predicts output for training data. 
it measures how wrong the predctions are.
it adjusts m and b in direction that reduces the error.
this repeats until the model becomes accurate
I Learned How LinearRegression Works Under The hood
