# Data Science Fundamentals

This repository contains my foundational work in data science:
NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. All code was written from scratch 
as part of my journey toward ML engineering.

## Contents
- **numpy_basics.py** – vectorization, slicing, reshaping, indexing
- **pandas_basics.py** – CSV loading, DataFrames, groupby, filtering
- **matplotlib_basics.py** – bar charts, scatter plots, histograms
- **pokemon.csv** – data file used for experiments

## Goals
- Build core DS foundations
- Prepare for machine learning libraries (sklearn, pytorch)
- Practice real data manipulation and visualization
